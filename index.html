  <p><b>Introduction to Programming Stage 0</b></p>
<p>The web is made up of a Collection of <b>HTML</b> documents. <em>(Hypertext Markup Language)</em><br>
  All types of files can be found on the web but HTML is the main type of content</p>

<b>Major pieces that make up the web</b><br>
My computer<br>
The internet<br> 
Servers<br>
HTTP<br>
<p><b>HTML</b> <em>(Hypertext Markup Language)</em><br>
HTML is made up of:<br>
Text content – What you see.<br>
Markup – what it looks like.<br>
References to other documents – pictures, movies etc.<br>
  Links to other pages.</p>
<p>HTML Markup: Structeral makeup is of TAGS, Elements and Attributes   <p><b>HTML Structural Vocabulary</b><br><b>Tag:</b> Contained within brackets (</>) most tags have an opening and closing. If you don’t close your command with the closing tag your command will continue with the rest of your work. There are some tags that don't require a closing like the line break tag "br".<br><b>Elements:</b>This refers to everything withing the set of opening and closing tags.<br><b>Attributes:</b>This is a variable contained within the HTML element.</p>
"b" B tag stands for <b>bold</b>. Everything within the "Opening" and "Closing" tags will be bold.<br>
"em" em tag stands for emphasis. This makes things <em>ITALIC</em>. Everything within the "Opening" and "Closing" tags will be italic.
</p> 

  HTML Attributes : Specifies the value of the text content. <p>< TAG ATTR=”Value”> contents < /TAG ></p>
"a" The anchor tag is for making links.<br>

Href = attribute name<br>
value = URL<br>
derp = the name viewers will see as a hypler link.<br><br><b>(Is it appropriate to use two br tags instead of a p tag to creat a space here?)</b>
<p>Attribute Example: (This website is < a href="www.udacity.com">my favorite< /a>)
  Will be seen as : <b>This website is <a href="www.udacity.com">my favorite</a></b></p>
<p>IMAGE TAG : "img" for including images. No closing tag needed for images.<br>
Image example < img src=”url” alt=”text” >
Img = image tag<br>
Src = source This is the location of the image file.<br> 
url = link to image<br>
alt = alternate attribute this contains text that will be displayed in case the image fails to load</p>

  <p><b>Whitespace</b><br> HTML doesn’t recognize white space. You need to create it.<br>
"br" tag break (void)<br>
    "p" paragraph</p> 
<p><b>Inline vs. Block TAG</b><br>"br" Is an inline tag. Inline tags just manipulat code at the line. Other inline tags (b, em, img)<br>
  "p" Is a block tag. Blog tags create a scalable bloc of code to manipulate.</p>

  <p><b>SPAN / DIV</b>
<span >text< /span> (inline)
  <div >text< /div> (block)</p>span:<br>div:<br></p>
